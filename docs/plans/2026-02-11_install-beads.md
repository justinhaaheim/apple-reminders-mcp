# Install Beads for Issue Tracking

**Date**: 2026-02-11
**Status**: Complete

## Goal

Add [beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) (`bd`) to the project for granular issue/task tracking, supplementing the existing scratchpad + ROADMAP system.

## What Was Done

- [x] Installed `bd` globally via the curl install script
- [x] Ran `bd init` to create `.beads/` directory with config, database, and JSONL files
- [x] Created `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` — installs `bd` and deps on Claude Code Web only (checks `CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE` env var)
- [x] Wired the SessionStart hook into `.claude/settings.json`
- [x] Added beads quick reference and usage guidance to `CLAUDE.md`
- [x] `AGENTS.md` was auto-generated by `bd init` with landing-the-plane instructions

## Design Decisions

- **Beads supplements, does not replace** the scratchpad/ROADMAP system. Beads is for concrete tasks with status tracking; scratchpads are for design notes and session context.
- **SessionStart hook only runs on Claude Code Web** (`CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true`). Local users install `bd` manually.
- The hook also runs `bun i` to ensure deps are installed in web environments.
